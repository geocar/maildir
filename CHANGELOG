	* unix/maildir.c: reverse srs for RPLINE writing (i think) and
	  checking

	* unix/maildir.c: maildir now includes rpline and dtline, smtpd now
	  supports a control/domainenv file that allows environment
	  variable setting per rcpthost, attempted portability for
	  ulimit-probe, increase mproc timeout to 60, deploy no longer
	  demands mproc

	* unix/maildir.c: remove this case insensitive junk... it was a
	  dumb idea and didn't really fix the real problem

	* unix/maildir.c: maildir is now case insensitive

2004-06-09 20:08  geocar

	* unix/maildir.c: make the locking code sane, add tracing code to
	  batsh, error reporting to maildir, shorter journal names,
	  overflow fixes to batsh, sanity fixes.  batsh now works properly.
	  smtpd now puts timeofday in received header to get a better
	  picture on concurrency. svfilter deliver script now works in
	  sandbox, and better error reporting for sf-check.

	* unix/maildir.c, common/hostname.c: batsh supports multiple
	  invocations now, some better stat-tests to accomodate test(1)
	  style comparisons, and updates to the manual page.  new tool:
	  maildir does qmail-style maildir delivery and added first version
	  of batsh delivery script
